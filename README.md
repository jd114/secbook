# Information Security Practitioners Booklist Recommendation
The book lists are classic books that have been personally read or recognized by the industry. Unlike the safety book lists listed on the Internet, all safety books on the online store are not listed. If you have any good book recommendations, you can submit it on `Issues`, or submit it for merging. After I read it, I will update it here if I think it is possible. The book list will also be updated from time to time.
